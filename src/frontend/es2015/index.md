## What is ES2015?

ES2015 (or ES6) is the sixth version of JS which released in 2015. ES2015 corrected a lot of behavior in JS that caused many a headache for JS developers. It wasn't until this version that many developers considered it a mature language while, even still, some don't. Whatever peoples opinion of JS, it isn't going anywhere. So it is a really important language to learn. It's imperative for the frontend but already has a ton of support on the backend and is only gaining speed. Let's take a look at why this version really changed the game.
