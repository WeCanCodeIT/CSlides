## Manifesto for Agile Software Development

[http://agilemanifesto.org/](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

<ul>
	<div class="fragment agile-value">
		<li><strong>Individuals and Interactions</strong> over processes and tools</li>
	</div>
	<div class="fragment agile-value">
		<li><strong>Working Software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</li>
	</div>
	<div class="fragment agile-value">
		<li><strong>Customer Collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</li>
	</div>
	<div class="fragment agile-value">
		<li><strong>Responding to Change</strong> over following a plan</li>
	</div>
</ul>

<p class="fragment">That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>

## Embrace Change

- "Day by day nothing seems to change, but pretty soon everything is different"
	-Calvin and Hobbes

- Manage Goals instead of activities
	- Scrum
	- Extreme Programming
	- Trello Boards

% TODO what is this?

	Analysis-Design-Code-Test-Production

## The Team

- cohesion
- egotistical programmers competing against each other = low productivity
- ordinary programmers working cooperatively = high productivity

## The Customer

- essential to the team
- software developers are not experts in their customer's businesses
